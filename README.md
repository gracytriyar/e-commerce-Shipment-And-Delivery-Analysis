# E-Commerce SQL Analysis – Delivery Performance & Customer Behavior

This project explores an e-commerce shipment dataset using SQL to derive insights related to delivery performance, customer satisfaction, and warehouse efficiency.

## Dataset Tables Used:
- `shipments` – Delivery data including on-time status, shipment mode, warehouse block
- `products` – Product discount and importance
- `customers` – Ratings and customer care calls
- `brands` – Brand names

## 🎯 Problem Statement

How do shipment methods, product discounts, warehouse operations, and customer interactions influence delivery efficiency and satisfaction in an e-commerce platform?


## Key Questions Answered:
1. Which brand has the most products listed?
2. Which product category has the highest late delivery rate?
3. Which mode of shipment has the highest on-time delivery percentage?
4. Which brand has the highest cancellation rate (based on late deliveries)?
5. Which warehouse block is the most efficient (on-time delivery)?
6. Are highly important products more likely to be delivered late?
7. Do higher customer care calls correlate with late delivery?
8. Which warehouse block sees the most customer care calls?
9. Do late deliveries result in lower customer ratings?
10. Which brand receives the most poor ratings from customers?

## SQL Concepts Used:
- `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`
- Aggregates: `COUNT`, `AVG`
- Conditional logic: `CASE WHEN`
- Table joins
